# Queens-8
Queens 8 Challenge
to those unfamiliar with the Queens 8 challenge, it is a challenge to place 8 Queens on a classic 8x8 chessboard and have no Queen be able to take out any other Queen in one move. A Queen is able to move across the entire board vertically, horiznotally as well as diagonally.
There are 92 solutions. This was my very close attempt at finding all 92.
